What is this?

This is an all-stop-shop for a concerned citizen wanting to get the government to do something.

Use-cases:
1) Follow the status of a case or cases (verify the integrity of the status)
2) Find out protests near you
3) Get connected with pro-bono lawyers easily
4) Access resources on how not to get detained in an act of civil disobedience
5) Draw causal infographics that track how an issue develops and how it can be mitigated / resolved
6) Tools to mass-analyze documents via schematization
... and more!

Goal:
Don't you worry about latency. Reusability. Good practices. None of these things are important.
The only important thing is: to add lines in a consistent basis. To build a shitty PoC to show people and
build a community around.

Architecture:
Svelte + Supabase. Edge functions for hiding away complicated stuff to the backend. No fancy CSS stuff (other than Material Design icons, but that's it.)
